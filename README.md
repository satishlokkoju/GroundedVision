**GroundedVision** explores the intersection of Computer Vision and the construction domain. This repository contains experiments and reference implementations for analyzing dynamic job sites, including:

* Safety Compliance: PPE detection and hazard identification.

* Progress Monitoring: Geometric comparison and activity recognition.

* Quality Control: Semantic segmentation for defect detection in concrete and structural elements."
